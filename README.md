# Maze Solver

A Python application for solving mazes using various algorithms like BFS,DFS,Generic Algorithm,A* algo , built with Tkinter for the GUI.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Maze Solver, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   First, clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mo-Khater/Maze-solver.git
2. **Install Dependencies**

  This project requires Pillow for image processing. Install it using pip:
  pip install Pillow
  
3. **Run the Application**

  To start the application, run the main Python script:
    python Maze_solver.py

## Follow These Steps in the Application

1. Choose the map you want to solve.
2. Select the algorithm you want to use to solve the maze.

## Default Maps

The repository includes default maps that you can use for testing and solving.

## Usage

- Launch the application by executing the main Python script.
- In the GUI, you will find options to load a maze map and select from various solving algorithms.
- Click on the algorithm you wish to use to solve the maze and observe the solution.
